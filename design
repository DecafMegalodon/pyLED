pyLED will consist of two parts: the high level API (python) and a low-level arduino interpreter, which recieves communications over USB. This allows a wide range of devices to control an LED strip without any presumption of the precise timing capabilities on the API host.

Interpreter:
The arduino interpreter's job is mostly to isolate the LED strip from the unreliable timing of the API. WS2812 LED strips require microsecond precision - something we cannot promise on a real-time multiprocess operating system such as Raspbery Pi OS (although in the Pi's case we can perform some hacks with the PCM GPIO pins to increase this reliability).
