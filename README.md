# pyLED
A high level python library for controlling LED strips

It will require pyserial, which can be install with pip install pyserial.

TODO: The code may not work on a freshly booted linux system. Unplugging and replugging the USB cable to the arduino seems to mostly fix this issue but it may be possible to add more automated issue mitigation
